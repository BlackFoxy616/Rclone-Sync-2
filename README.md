# Description

Put simply, it regularly triggers GitHub Actions to execute a script that pair-wise iterates and runs `rclone sync` over
defined drives.

# Dependencies 🧰

- ~~rclone~~ [gclone](https://github.com/dogbutcat/gclone) 🎉
- python3
- brain

# Usage 👨‍💻

1. Create an `rclone.conf` file that complies with [RClone](https://rclone.org/).
2. Host it on some online paste bin. I personally use Secret Gists (yep, I’m obsessed with version control, how’d you
   guess?).
3. Fork/mirror this repo.
4. Create a GitHub Secret called `CONF_URL` and set it's value as the link to the rclone config (make sure you copy the
   link to the "RAW Text").
5. Edit the `from_drives` and `to_drives` in [`sync.py`](sync.py) as you wish.
6. The script is set to run every day at 6:30 AM UTC. Feel free to modify that
   under [`.github/workflows/sync.yaml`](.github/workflows/sync.yaml).
7. Profit 💯

## Using Service Accounts (optional)

1. Generate the SA jsons and put them in a folder called `accounts` in your PC.
2. Zip **the folder** and name it as `accounts.zip`.
3. Upload it somewhere such that you can have a static direct download link (opening this link locally should directly
   start downloading the zip).
4. Create a GitHub Secret called `SA_ZIP` and set it's value as the link to the SA zip.

Note: The [`sync.sh`](sync.sh) file is a bash equivalent of the [`sync.py`](sync.py). If you want to tinker with this
project but you don't like/know Python3, feel free to start there.
